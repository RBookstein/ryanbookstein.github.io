I am a second-year PhD Student in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland focused on American Politics. My current research explores congressional decision-making, focusing on how factors like perceptions of agency ideology, divided government, polarization, and timing shape executive branch nomination votes. I also study political parties and representation. In my minor field, Quantitative Methodology & Formal Theory, I am interested in Computational Political Science.
